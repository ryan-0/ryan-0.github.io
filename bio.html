      <div id = "bio">	 
      <p> <br><br> I was born in Paris, France to a French-Algerian mother and an American father. I grew up an hour north of the French capital in a town called Lamorlaye. At the age of 10, I moved to Lugano, Switzerland where I started middle-school and then highschool. <br><br>
      In high school,I played varsity basketball and volleyball and was a student representative. Because it was a boarding school, I was also a middle school proctor my junior year and then Head Proctor my senior year.
      I then moved to the USA for college and am now attending Tufts Univeristy in Massachusetts studying Computer Science and Entrepreneurial Leadership.
        <br><br>
      I am a creative, motivated, and driven individual with great communication and team-building skills who is trying to gain more experience in different work environments. I'm most passionate about finding creative solutions and ideas to everyday problems as well as working with and learning from experienced professionals in all fields.</p>
