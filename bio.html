    <p> Hi guys! My name is Ryan, I'm 19 years old and here is my story. I was born in Paris, France to a French-Algerian mother and an American father. I grew up an hour north of the French capital in a town called Lamorlaye. At the age of 10, I moved to Lugano(pictured), Switzerland where I started middle-school and then highschool. <br><br>
    In high school,I played varsity basketball and volleyball and was a student representative. Because it was a boarding school, I was also a middle school proctor my junior year and then Head Proctor my senior year.<br><br>
    I then moved to the USA for college and am now attending Tufts Univeristy in Massachusetts. I'm a sophomore studying computer science and entrepeneurial leadership. I also rowed for Tufts for a year and half and was a fellow and now a mentor for the Compass Fellowship. Compass is a national organization that focuses on social entrepreneurship. I am passionate about entrepeneurship and hope to one day open my own company in the tech industry. </p>
